// write an if-else chain.

// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

let alien_color1 = "red";
alien_color1 == "green"
  ? console.log("Nice Shot:( You got 5 points")
  : console.log("You got 10 points");
