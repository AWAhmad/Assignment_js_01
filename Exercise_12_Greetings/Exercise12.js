// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
// should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

const names = ["Ahmad", "Saif", "Ali", "Umer"];
console.log("This msg is personally belongs to ", names[0]);
console.log("This msg is personally belongs to ", names[1]);
console.log("This msg is personally belongs to ", names[2]);
console.log("This msg is personally belongs to ", names[3]);
